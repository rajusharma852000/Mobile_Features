This website has been created using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The main features of the website are as follows:
1. Clicking the "up-arrow" rotates the current feature of the phone 90 degrees counterclockwise, revealing a new feature. This rotation is animated with a transition time of 1 second.
2. Conversely, clicking the "down-arrow" rotates the current feature 90 degrees clockwise, revealing a new feature. This rotation is also animated with a transition time of 1 second.

Detailed explanation:
A. There are four features of the mobile phone displayed on the screen: Camera, Processor, Display, and Battery.
B. These features are positioned along the boundary of a circle, with each feature located at a 90-degree angle from the others.
C. Upon each click, the circle rotates either clockwise or counterclockwise by 90 degrees, depending on the arrow clicked.
D. All features, except the currently displayed one, have the same color as the background, making them appear invisible until revealed by rotation.
